Cansolair Efficiency Monitoring Using an Arduino


Following are the people I would like to thank for their assistance and support throughout various aspects of my project throughout late 2016 and early 2017.

Faculty of NSCC:
•	Glenn Macleod
•	Steve MacCarron
•	Alain Joseph
•	James Thomson
•	Dale Jollimore


Description:
This was the final project for my two year Electrical Engineering Technology, completed in April of 2017. The purpose of this project is to monitor the heat energy generated by the Cansolair solar heater. This was proposed to me as it would provide useful information about the value of the heater. The heater had been installed at the school years before and there was little information about it's specific efficiency.
